Psychic Game from Week 4 of Bootcamp: functions, arrays, conditionals

The following game utilizes the use of functions, arrays and conditionals. The user uses their keyboard to guess a random letter that the computer has chosen secretly. Each incorrect letter takes away from the '9' guesses allowed and adds the letter to the array of 'Your Guesses so far' as well as adds to your 'Losses:' count. When you run out of guesses, the game is over. If you guess the correct letter, the game is done and a point is added to your 'Wins:' count. At the end of each game, the random letter is refreshed and the game can begin again.

The use of an alert is shown by displaying a pop-up alert letting the user know when the game is over with the message, "Game Over!"

Some improvements for the future:
  - Styling of page
  - Styling of displaying scores and guesses left
  - The use of a form to be able to guess in a more interactive way
